# CsharpGradeBook

Console application I built whilst learning the fundamentals of C#  


## Requirements
>*"We need an electronic grade book to read the scores of an individual student and then compute some simple statistics from the scores.*  
>*The grades are entered as floating point numbers from 0 to 100, and the statistics should show us the highest grade, the lowest grade, and the average grade."*

## Setup
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/BecaLParker/CsharpGradeBook.git`
2. Navigate to the GradeBook directory `cd src/GradeBook/`

## What does this code do? (user instructions and example outputs)

### Returns the average grade to one decimal place
- Type `dotnet run`  
> `Average = 17.9`
